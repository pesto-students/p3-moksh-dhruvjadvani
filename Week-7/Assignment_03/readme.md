Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to check if the linked list has a loop.
Linkedlist can contain self loop.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
x = 2O

output: True

Explanation: In above test case N = 3.The linked list with nodes N = 3 is given. Then value of x=2 is given which means last node is connected with xth node of linked list. Therefore, there exists a loop.
